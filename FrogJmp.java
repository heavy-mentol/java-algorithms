/*
	A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

	Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

	Write a function:

		class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }

	that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

	For example, given:
	  X = 10
	  Y = 85
	  D = 30

	the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

			after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
			after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
			after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

	Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

			X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
			X â‰¤ Y.
