/**
 * Please answer the question in Python or Java 8
 *
 * There are N boxes (numbered from 0 to N-1) arranged in a row. The K-th box contains A[K] bricks. In one move you can take one brick from some box and move it to a box next to it (on the left or on the right). What is the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box?
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * def solution (A)
 *
 * that, given an array A of N integers, returns the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box. If this is not possible, the function should return -1.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * 1. For A = [7, 15, 10, 8], the function should return 7. You can perform the following sequence of moves:
 *
 *     - move three bricks from box number 1 to the box on the left: [10, 12, 10, 8];
 *     - move two bricks from box number 1 to the box on the right: [10, 10, 12, 8];
 *     - finally, move two bricks from box number 2 to the last box: [10, 10, 10, 10).
 *
 * 2. For A = [11, 10, 8, 12, 8, 10, 11], the function should return 6. You can perform the following sequence of moves:
 *
 *     - move a brick from box number 0 to box number 2 (using two moves);
 *     - move a brick from the last box two positions to the left (using two moves);
 *     - move a brick from the middle box to each of its neighbors (another two moves).
 *
 * 3. For A = (7, 14, 10], the function should return -1. It is not possible to end up with exactly 10 bricks in each box.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * â€¢ N is an integer within the range [1..20]:
 *
 *     each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..200].
 *
 * In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
